# Hobbies

## Games
Outside of school I spend the most time playing golf. Although I'm not great at it, I still have a lot of fun. In addition to golf I play video games on my computer and sometimes my xbox. Currently my favorite game is *Rainbow Six: Siege*.

## Jobs
Although it is technically a job, I work at an escape room and I consider it a hobby. My [family](/AboutMe.md#family) is obsessed with escape rooms, we have done over 80 together. My personal escape rate is **95%** which I am pretty proud of. I have also worked as a counselor at a couple robotics summer camps for kids. I used to compete in robotic competitions in middle school and highschool.
