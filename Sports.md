# Sports
Although I don't currently play on any sport teams, I played lacrosse and wrestled in high school. I also currently coach the intramural soccer team at my fraternity.
## Lacrosse
I played lacrosse all four years of highschool, three of which were on varsity. I played defense and would sometimes substitute at midifield if necessary. 
## Wrestling
I wrestled for two years of highschool, both varsity. I competed in the 122, 126, and 132 pound weight classes and won [league champion](https://hwchronicle.com/50272/sports/four-wrestlers-advance-to-mission-league-finals/) my sophomore year at 126.
## Bowling
Although I was never on a super competitive team I did still bowl in a league once. I bowled for the *Bahama Mamas*, a squad consisting of me and three of my friends from highschool.
